code: W391
message: "Blank line at end of file"
title: "Blank line at end of file (W391)"
---

There should be one, and only one, blank line at the end of each file. This warning will occur when there are zero, two, or more than two blank lines.

### Anti-pattern

Imagine the example below is an entire file.

```python
class MyClass(object):
    pass



```

### Best practice

```python
class MyClass(object):
    pass
```
