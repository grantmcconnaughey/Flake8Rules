code: E272
message: "Multiple spaces before keyword"
title: "Multiple spaces before keyword (E272)"

There should be only one space before a keyword.

### Anti-pattern

In this example there are two spaces before the `in` keyword.

```python
def func():
    if 1  in [1, 2, 3]:
        print('yep!')
```

### Best practice
```python
def func():
    if 1 in [1, 2, 3]:
        print('yep!')
```
