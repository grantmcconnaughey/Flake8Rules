title: "Deprecated form of raising exception (W602)"
---

The `raise Exception, message` form of raising exceptions is deprecated. Use the new form.

### Anti-pattern

```python
def can_drive(age):
    if age < 16:
        raise ValueError, 'Not old enough to drive'
    return True
```

### Best practice

```python
def can_drive(age):
    if age < 16:
        raise ValueError('Not old enough to drive')
    return True
```
