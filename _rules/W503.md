Line breaks should occur after the binary operator to keep all variable names aligned.

This rule goes against the PEP 8 recommended style, which was changed on April 16th, 2016 in [this commit](https://github.com/python/peps/commit/c59c4376ad233a62ca4b3a6060c81368bd21e85b). The tool [will soon be updated](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/pull/502) to recommend the opposite: line breaks *should* occur before the binary operator because it keeps all operators aligned.

### Anti-pattern

**Note:** Despite being in the anti-pattern section, this will soon be considered the best practice.

```python
income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest)
```
