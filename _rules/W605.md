As of Python 3.6, a backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence now generates a DeprecationWarning. Although this will eventually become a SyntaxError, that will not be for several Python releases.

### Anti-pattern

```python
regex = r'\.png$'
```

### Best practice

```python
regex = '\.png$'
```
