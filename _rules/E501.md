Line lengths are recommended to be no greater than 79 characters. The reasoning for this comes from PEP8 itself:

> Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several files open side-by-side, and works well when using code review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.

It is fairly common for developers, especially those in closed-source projects, to change the maximum line length to 100 or 120 characters.
