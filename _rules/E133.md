A closing bracket is missing indentation. This error only occurs if the `--hang-closing` flag is used, switching the default behavior of closing brackets so that they require hanging indents.

### Anti-pattern

**Note:** This is not an anti-pattern by default. This only occurs if the `--hang-closing` flag is used.

```python
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
]
```

### Best practice

```python
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
    ]
```
