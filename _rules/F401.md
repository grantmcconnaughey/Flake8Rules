code: F401
message: "Module imported but unused"
title: "Module imported but unused (F401)"

A module has been imported but is not used anywhere in the file. The module should either be used or the import should be removed.

### Anti-pattern

In this example, it is likely that `namedtuple` was going to be used instead of a regular `tuple`. However, `namedtuple` was never used. It should be removed.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

my_tuple = ('Grant', 'McConnaughey', 25)
```

### Best practice


```python
my_tuple = ('Grant', 'McConnaughey', 25)
```
