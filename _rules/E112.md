This issue occurs when code is not indented but should be.

### Anti-pattern

```python
def print_list(my_list):
"""This should be indented"""
    print('Nope')
```

### Best practice

Indent the docstring by four spaces.

```python
def print_list(my_list):
    """This should be indented"""
    print('Nope')
```
