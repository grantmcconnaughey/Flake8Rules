Inline comments should have two spaces before them. Often programmers will only include one space, which will trigger this warning.

### Anti-pattern

```python
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name) # This comment needs an extra space
```

### Best practice


```python
def print_name(self):
    print(self.name)  # Comment is correct now
```
