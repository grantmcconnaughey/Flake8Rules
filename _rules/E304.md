There should be no blank lines between a function decorator and the function it is decorating.

### Anti-pattern

In this example, the `property` decorator has a space between it and the `name` method. The space should be removed.

```python
class User(object):

    @property

    def name(self):
        pass
```

### Best practice

```python
class User(object):

    @property
    def name(self):
        pass
```
