Two blank lines are expected between functions and classes and one blank line is expected between methods of a class.

### Anti-pattern

This example has too many blank lines.

```python
def func1():
    pass



def func2():
    pass
```

### Best practice

```python
def func1():
    pass


def func2():
    pass
```
