code: E274
message: "Tab before keyword"
title: "Tab before keyword (E274)"

There should be only one space before a keyword.

### Anti-pattern

In this example there is a tab before the `in` keyword.

**Note:** The `→` character represents a tab.

```python
def func():
    if 1→in [1, 2, 3]:
        print('yep!')
```

### Best practice

Use only one space before the `in` operator.

```python
def func():
    if 1 in [1, 2, 3]:
        print('yep!')
```
