code: W291
message: "Trailing whitespace"
title: "Trailing whitespace (W291)"

There should be no whitespace after the final character in a line.

### Anti-pattern

**Note:** The `•` character represents a space.

```python
def first_func():
    # The line below has two spaces after its final character
    pass••
```
